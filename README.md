## LibDriver MAX31865

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/max31865/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The MAX31865 is an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used and a precision delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference resistance into digital form. The MAX31865’s inputs are protected against overvoltage faults as large as Q45V. Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and short conditions is included. MAX31865 is used in industrial equipment, instruments and medical devices.

LibDriver MAX31865 is a full-featured driver of MAX31865 launched by LibDriver.It provides functions of PT temperature continuous mode reading, PT temperature single mode reading, etc. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver MAX31865 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver MAX31865 SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver MAX31865 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver MAX31865 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver MAX31865 offline document.

/datasheet includes MAX31865 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_max31865_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temp;

res = max31865_basic_init(MAX31865_WIRE_4, MAX31865_RESISTOR_1000PT, 430.f);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = max31865_basic_read((float *)&temp);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)max31865_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    max31865_interface_debug_print("max31865: temperature is %0.4fC.\n", temp);
    max31865_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)max31865_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_max31865_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temp;

res = max31865_shot_init(MAX31865_WIRE_4, MAX31865_RESISTOR_1000PT, 430.f);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = max31865_shot_read((float *)&temp);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)max31865_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    max31865_interface_debug_print("max31865: temperature is %0.4fC.\n", temp);
    max31865_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)max31865_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
